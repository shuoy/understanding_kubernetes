Building Your First Kubernetes Cluster on Your Local Machine
============================================================

In this step, we are going to build a Kubernetes cluster with two nodes.
Though playing with Kubernetes in single node mode is Ok, we believe that
learning and playing with a distributed Kubernetes cluster will give people
more intuitive learning experience and grasp more details out of the learning
process - a learning process that can immediately get transferred to the
confidence in building and using a real Kubernetes cluster.

Note: we will be building an HA Kubernetes cluster in
[the later step in this tutorial](../step_09_build_your_ha_kubernetes_cluster/README.md)
